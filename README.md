This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Requirements
1. Node.Js version 20 or latest
2. Java version 17 or latest
3. XCode version 16 or latest (for IOS)
4. Android Studio (for Android)

# Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create .env file from the root of your project and make sure add the BASE_API_URL (see .env.example)
3. npm install
4. run your project

# Getting Started (Official)

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Build and run your app

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Testing

```sh
# Using npm
npm run test

# OR
npx jest
```

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
